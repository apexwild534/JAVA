Array of Objects in Java:

An array of objects in Java is an array where each element of the array is an object of a class or a reference to an object. It allows you to store multiple instances of objects of the same class in a single array. Here are the key points to understand about arrays of objects:

Array Declaration and Initialization:

To declare an array of objects, you specify the class type followed by square brackets, like this:

ClassName[] arrayName;


To create an array and allocate memory for a specific number of objects, you use the new keyword:


ClassName[] arrayName = new ClassName[size];



Creating Objects for the Array:

After declaring an array of objects, you need to create objects for each element in the array. 
To initialize each element with an object, you can use a loop or individually assign objects to array elements.

Accessing Objects in the Array:

You can access individual objects in the array using the array index (0-based).


Iterating Over an Array of Objects:

You can use loops, such as for or foreach, to iterate over an array of objects and perform operations on each object.


Array Length:

You can obtain the length of an array (the number of elements it can hold) using the length attribute of the array.



Array of Objects vs. Primitive Arrays:

An array of objects can store instances of any class or subclass, making it versatile for handling different types of objects.
Primitive arrays (e.g., int[], double[]) can only store primitive data types and cannot hold objects.
