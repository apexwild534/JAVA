Constructors

In Java, a constructor is a special type of method that is used to initialize objects when they are created. Constructors have the same name as the class they belong to and do not have a return type, not even void. They are automatically called when an object is instantiated using the new keyword. Constructors are primarily used to set initial values for an object's attributes (fields) or perform any necessary setup.

Here are some key points about constructors in Java:

Default Constructor:

If a class does not explicitly define any constructors, Java provides a default constructor with no arguments. This default constructor initializes the object's attributes with default values (e.g., 0 for numeric types, null for reference types).
You can also define your own default constructor if needed.
Parameterized Constructors:

Constructors can have parameters, allowing you to pass values to initialize an object with specific values.
You can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameter lists (constructor overloading).
Constructor Overloading:

Constructor overloading is a practice where a class has multiple constructors with different parameter lists.
Overloaded constructors provide flexibility when creating objects with various sets of initial values.
this Keyword:

Inside a constructor, you can use the this keyword to refer to the current instance of the class. This is useful when you have parameter names that conflict with field names.
Initialization Blocks:

In addition to constructors, you can use initialization blocks (static and instance initialization blocks) to perform additional initialization tasks.
Explicitly Calling Constructors:

Constructors can call other constructors within the same class using this(...). This allows you to reuse code and provide default values for constructor parameters.
Constructor Chaining:

You can chain constructors within a class by calling one constructor from another using this(...). This is often used to avoid duplicating code.
