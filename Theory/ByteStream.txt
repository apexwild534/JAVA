Byte Stream

In Java, byte streams are used to perform input and output operations for binary data, which means they deal with raw bytes rather than character data. Byte streams are typically used for reading and writing files, network communication, and any other situation where data is transferred as a stream of bytes. There are two main classes in Java for handling byte streams: InputStream for reading and OutputStream for writing.

Here are some key points about byte streams:

InputStream:

InputStream is an abstract class that serves as the superclass for various input byte stream classes.
It is used for reading raw bytes from different sources, such as files, network sockets, or in-memory byte arrays.
OutputStream:

OutputStream is an abstract class that serves as the superclass for various output byte stream classes.
It is used for writing raw bytes to different destinations, such as files, network sockets, or in-memory byte arrays.
Common Byte Stream Classes:

Some commonly used byte stream classes include FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, BufferedInputStream, BufferedOutputStream, DataInputStream, DataOutputStream, and ByteArrayInputStream.
Binary Data:

Byte streams are suitable for handling binary data, which can include images, audio, video, or any other non-textual information.
Unlike character streams, byte streams don't perform character encoding or decoding, making them suitable for raw binary data.
Reading and Writing:

To read data from an InputStream, you typically use methods like read() to read a single byte or read(byte[]) to read a buffer of bytes.
To write data to an OutputStream, you use methods like write(int) to write a single byte or write(byte[]) to write a buffer of bytes.
Exception Handling:

When working with byte streams, you should handle exceptions like IOException to deal with potential errors during input/output operations.


Byte streams are crucial for working with binary data and low-level I/O operations in Java. They provide a way to read and write data without interpreting or altering its content, making them suitable for a wide range of applications.
