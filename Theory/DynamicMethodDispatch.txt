Dynamic Method Dispatch


Dynamic method dispatch, also known as runtime polymorphism or late binding, is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming languages like Java. It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The choice of which method implementation to execute is made at runtime, depending on the actual object type.

Here's how dynamic method dispatch works in Java:

Inheritance Hierarchy: Dynamic method dispatch requires a class hierarchy, where a subclass inherits from a superclass. The superclass contains a method that can be overridden by the subclass.

Method Overriding: In the subclass, you override the method from the superclass by providing a new implementation with the @Override annotation. The method signature (name, return type, and parameters) must be the same as in the superclass.

Polymorphic Reference: You create a reference variable of the superclass type and assign an object of the subclass to it. This allows you to treat the subclass object as an instance of the superclass.

Method Invocation: You can call the overridden method using the reference variable. The actual method implementation that gets executed depends on the runtime type of the object assigned to the reference variable.

Dynamic method dispatch is a powerful mechanism for achieving polymorphism in Java, allowing you to write flexible and extensible code that can work with objects of different classes in a unified manner.
