Interface



In Java, an interface is a core concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) that defines a contract or a set of abstract methods that must be implemented by any class that claims to implement the interface. It allows for multiple inheritance of method signatures, as a class can implement multiple interfaces. Interfaces are a way to achieve abstraction and provide a mechanism for establishing common behavior across unrelated classes.

Here are key points and concepts related to interfaces in Java:

Declaration of an Interface:

An interface is declared using the interface keyword, followed by the interface's name.
Interfaces can contain method declarations (without method bodies), constant variables (implicitly public, static, and final), and nested types (e.g., other interfaces or classes).

Implementing an Interface:

To use an interface, a class must implement it using the implements keyword.
A class that implements an interface must provide concrete (non-abstract) implementations for all the methods declared in the interface.


Multiple Interface Implementation:

A class can implement multiple interfaces by separating the interface names with commas.
This allows a class to inherit and provide implementations for multiple sets of behavior defined in different interfaces.


Default and Static Methods:

In Java 8 and later, interfaces can include default and static methods that provide method implementations.
Default methods have the default keyword and allow interfaces to add new methods without breaking existing implementing classes.
Static methods have the static keyword and are called on the interface itself, not on instances of implementing classes.


Purpose of Interfaces:

Interfaces are used to define a contract for classes to follow, ensuring that they provide specific behavior.
They promote code reusability and flexibility by allowing unrelated classes to share a common set of methods.
Interfaces are commonly used for defining callbacks, creating API contracts, and achieving polymorphism.
Functional Interfaces: A functional interface is a special type of interface that contains exactly one abstract method. Functional interfaces can be used with lambda expressions, making them useful for defining inline implementations of single-method interfaces.



Marker Interfaces: Marker interfaces are empty interfaces without any method declarations. They are used to indicate a certain capability or quality of a class. Examples include Serializable and Cloneable.

Interfaces play a crucial role in Java's support for abstraction, encapsulation, and polymorphism. They allow for the creation of flexible and extensible software by specifying a contract that classes must adhere to while providing implementations in a decoupled manner.
